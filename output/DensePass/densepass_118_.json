      "question": "What is located immediately to the right of the main entrance of the jewelry store at the center of the image?",
      "reasoning_chain": "The panoramic image shows a street scene with various storefronts. The central focus is a jewelry store with a glass entrance and illuminated interior. The main entrance is clearly visible at the center. Observing the area immediately to the right of this entrance, we see a group of three men standing on the sidewalk and a large white SUV parked just beyond them, almost aligned with the entrance and right edge of the jewelry store fa\u00e7ade.",

      "reasoning_chain": "On the left side of the image, several motorcycles are parked along the sidewalk. Observing the orientation of the motorcycles, most appear to be positioned parallel to the street with their front wheels pointing towards the viewer\u2019s right, suggesting they are facing towards the center of the image (towards the jewelry store entrance).",
      "final_answer": "The motorcycles are facing towards the center of the image, generally pointing right relative to the street."

      "question": "What is located across the street from the jewelry store entrance?",
      "reasoning_chain": "The jewelry store entrance is at the center of the image, and directly across the street, the panoramic perspective provides a view of several commercial shops. Visible are storefronts with red and yellow signage, mannequins dressed in red clothing, and a rickshaw parked nearby.",
