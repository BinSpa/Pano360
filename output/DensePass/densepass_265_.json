      "reasoning_chain": "1. The blue taxi is parked at the edge of a sidewalk near a corner.  \n2. The car rental building is directly adjacent to the blue taxi, with part of the taxi even within the boundary of the car rental\u2019s lot.  \n3. The round building with movie posters is across the street, requiring the taxi to cross the intersection to reach it.  \n4. The proximity of the car rental building to the taxi is much smaller than the distance to the round building.",

The tall skyscraper is seen further in the background, behind and to the left of the round building when analyzed from the viewer's perspective.  \n3. The skyscraper\u2019s relative position, compared to the round building, is not directly above but offset to the left.",

The car rental building is also visible on the right, placing both objects on the same side of the main road.  \n3. There is no major intersection or division between the billboard and the car rental; they are part of the same sidewalk stretch.",

To reach the round building, a person must cross the street, which is a significant obstacle, as it is wide and busy with moving vehicles.",
