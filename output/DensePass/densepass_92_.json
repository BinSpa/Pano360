      "reasoning_chain": "1. The sign \"\u6e56\u5357\u56fd\u9645\u73e0\u5b9d\u57ce\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8\" is prominently visible on the right side of the panorama, occupying a large portion of the field of view and displaying clear detail, indicating close proximity to the viewer.\n2. The buildings in the center of the panorama, including multiple high-rise apartments and commercial buildings, appear smaller and less detailed, suggesting they are farther from the viewer.\n3. Additionally, the perspective distortion near the right edge (w \u2248 2048) of the image suggests the camera was positioned almost directly in front of the jewelry city building's entrance, further confirming its closeness.",
      "final_answer": "Yes, the building with the sign \"\u6e56\u5357\u56fd\u9645\u73e0\u5b9d\u57ce\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8\" is much closer to the viewer than the central buildings."

      "question": "Are the two visible cars (one black and one brown) parked on the same side of the street, and what is their spatial relationship?",
      "reasoning_chain": "1. The black car appears in the left-center of the panorama, parked beside a sidewalk and facing slightly towards the viewer's left.\n2. The brown car appears to the right of the black car, parked closer to the foreground on the right side of the image, also adjacent to a sidewalk.\n3. The orientation and curb placement of both cars indicate they are parked along the same side of the street, facing in similar directions and separated by some distance along the curb.",
      "final_answer": "Yes, both cars are parked on the same side of the street, with the black car to the left and the brown car to the right (from the viewer\u2019s perspective)."

      "question": "Is the entrance to the jewelry market (the building with the vertical sign) facing the main road or a side road?",
      "reasoning_chain": "1. The main road, with visible traffic and central buildings, runs horizontally across the middle of the panorama.\n2. The entrance to the jewelry market is located on the rightmost side of the image, with its signage and architectural features facing towards the viewer.\n3. The perspective of the entrance and the sidewalk suggests it is not directly facing the main road, but rather is set back, possibly facing a side road or an open area leading towards the main road.",
      "final_answer": "The entrance to the jewelry market is facing a side road or an open area, not directly the main road."

    {
      "question": "Are there any tall tower structures visible in the panorama, and if so, on which side?",
      "reasoning_chain": "1. Scanning the panorama from left to right, a tall tower-like structure with a distinct spire or antenna is visible on the far left side of the image.\n2. There are no similar tall tower structures on the central or right sides; the buildings there are predominantly mid-rise or high-rise.",
      "final_answer": "Yes, a tall tower structure is visible on the far left side of the panorama."
