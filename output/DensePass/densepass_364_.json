      "question": "What type of business is located immediately to the right of the clothing store in the panoramic image?",
      "reasoning_chain": "1. The clothing store is identifiable by the display of mannequins and clothing in the large glass windows near the image center.\n2. To determine what is immediately to the right, follow the fa\u00e7ade to the next business, moving rightward from the clothing store.\n3. The next storefront has outdoor seating and a dark awning with the word \"RESTAURANT\" clearly visible in red neon signage above.\n4. This suggests a dining establishment is directly adjacent to the clothing store on the right.",

      "reasoning_chain": "1. The clothing store is central, with mannequins and clothes visible through large windows.\n2. Look for the Domino\u2019s Pizza sign; it is visible further to the left of the clothing store, above a separate entrance.\n3. The Domino\u2019s store is set back on the left-hand side, before reaching the street corner and farther away from the center.",

      "reasoning_chain": "1. Scan the image for recognizable emergency vehicle markings or symbols.\n2. On the far left, there is a white vehicle with a blue medical star and a siren, indicating it is a medical or emergency vehicle.\n3. Its location is across the street and to the left of the storefronts, parked at the curb.",

      "question": "What is directly in front of the storefronts along the sidewalk?",
      "reasoning_chain": "1. Examine the sidewalk area in front of the clothing store and adjacent businesses.\n2. There are bike racks with bicycles or empty slots, green trash bins, and some small trees planted in the pavement.\n3. This infrastructure is consistently aligned along the sidewalk in front of the shops.",

      "question": "Is there more vehicular traffic on the left or the right side of the panoramic image?",
      "reasoning_chain": "1. Observe the number and type of vehicles on both the left and right sides.\n2. On the left, there is a medical vehicle, a van, and other cars visible; on the right, there are several parked cars visible along the street.\n3. The left side has a mix of moving and stationary vehicles, while the right appears to be mostly parked cars.",
