      "question": "How are the three flagpoles positioned in relation to the main building with the red door in the center of the image?",
      "reasoning_chain": "1. The main building with the red door is located near the center-right of the panorama.\n2. Three flagpoles are visible in front of this building.\n3. The flagpoles are aligned parallel to the front facade of the building, standing a few meters away from the wall.\n4. The flags are between the sidewalk and the building, closer to the viewer in the image\u2019s perspective.\n5. The shadow of the flagpoles and a person on the ground confirms the relative positioning and direction of sunlight.",
      "final_answer": "The three flagpoles are positioned in front of and parallel to the main building with the red door, standing between the building and the open paved area."

      "question": "What objects are present in the leftmost part of the panorama, and how do their positions relate to each other?",
      "reasoning_chain": "1. The leftmost side of the panorama shows a building with a visible entrance and a sign above it.\n2. In front of the entrance, there are two stairways leading up to the doors.\n3. To the right of the stairways, there is a ramp with a handrail.\n4. The building is further back compared to the ramp and stairs, which are closer to the immediate foreground.",
      "final_answer": "The leftmost part contains a building with stairs and a ramp leading up to the main entrance, with the stairs and ramp positioned in front of the building."

      "reasoning_chain": "1. Several bicycle racks can be seen on the far right side and near the center-right of the image.\n2. The racks are placed in front of two different buildings: one by the building on the right edge, and some near the main building in the center-right.\n3. Most of the bicycles are stationed on the paved area, next to the buildings and adjacent to the sidewalk.",
      "final_answer": "Bicycle racks are located on the far right and center-right of the panorama, near the buildings and along the edge of the paved area."

      "question": "What is the spatial relationship between the rectangular planter and the trees in the center of the image?",
      "reasoning_chain": "1. In the center of the panorama, there is a raised, rectangular planter with bare soil or mulch.\n2. Several trees are planted inside this planter, their trunks emerging from within it.\n3. The planter is bordered by a low wall, separating it from the paved walkway surrounding it.",
      "final_answer": "The trees in the center are planted inside the raised rectangular planter, which is surrounded by a low retaining wall."
