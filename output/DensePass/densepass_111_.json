      "reasoning_chain": "1. Identify the green trash bin in the center-left of the image, placed near a small patch of artificial grass.\n2. Find the blue trash bin, which is visible on the right side of the image near a fenced area and motorcycles.\n3. Both bins are separated by a walkway and significant distance; the green bin is centrally located, while the blue bin is towards the right.",

      "reasoning_chain": "1. Examine the left half of the image, noting the presence of people sitting on a concrete bench but no visible restaurant-style outdoor seating.\n2. Observe the right half of the image, where multiple tables and chairs are set up outside food outlets, and additional seating is visible further right under umbrellas.\n3. Comparing both halves, the right half contains more organized outdoor dining areas.",
