      "question": "Which side of the panoramic image contains the red double-decker bus, and what is its spatial relationship to the main historic building with columns?",
      "reasoning_chain": "- The image spans a wide city street, capturing various buildings and street elements across its width.  \n- The red double-decker bus is a common sight in London and stands out in the right half of the image.  \n- The main historic building with columns, likely a courthouse or similar, is also located in the right half of the image, distinguished by its prominent classical architecture and position across the street from the viewer.  \n- Observing the bus's location, it is in front of a modern glass-fronted building and slightly to the right relative to the historic columned building, on the opposite side of the street.",
      "final_answer": "The red double-decker bus is on the right side of the panoramic image, and it is positioned to the right of and across the street from the main historic building with columns."

      "question": "Is there a church or historic structure visible, and where is it located relative to the street intersection?",
      "reasoning_chain": "- The left side of the panorama features a long, stone building with arched windows and gothic elements, enclosed by a red and gold fence, which is characteristic of a church or historic structure.\n- There is a prominent street intersection near the middle of the image, with people crossing and traffic lights.\n- The church or historic structure is located to the left of this intersection, occupying much of the leftmost portion of the image.",
      "final_answer": "Yes, a church or historic structure is visible on the left side of the panoramic image, situated to the left of the main street intersection."

    {
      "question": "Where are the pedestrians most concentrated in the image, and what is their orientation relative to the street?",
      "reasoning_chain": "- Pedestrians appear throughout the panorama, but their highest concentration is near the center, close to the intersection and traffic lights.\n- Most pedestrians are seen walking parallel to the street or crossing at the intersection, indicating foot traffic is heaviest where sidewalks converge near the junction.",
      "final_answer": "Pedestrians are most concentrated near the center of the image, around the intersection, and are oriented both parallel to and across the street."

    {
      "question": "What is the relationship between the historic round building with white pillars and the multi-story stone building with storefronts?",
      "reasoning_chain": "- The round building with white pillars appears just right of the center of the image, directly facing the intersection.\n- The multi-story stone building with storefronts is further right, across the street, and extends along the road.\n- The round building is diagonally opposite the stone building with storefronts, separated by the intersection and main street.",
      "final_answer": "The round historic building with white pillars is diagonally opposite the multi-story stone building with storefronts, each on different sides of the main intersection."
