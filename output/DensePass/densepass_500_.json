      "question": "If a person is walking along the sidewalk on the left side of the image, which direction must they turn to reach the main entrance of the building with the arched doorway?",
      "reasoning_chain": "1. The panoramic image shows a street with a central building that has a prominent arched doorway, visible slightly right of center.  \n2. The sidewalk on the left runs along a hedge and a stone wall, parallel to the street.  \n3. The arched doorway is on the right side of the main road, accessible from the street, not directly from the left-side sidewalk.  \n4. To reach the entrance, the person walking along the left sidewalk would need to turn right at the intersection visible in the center of the image, cross the street, and then approach the arched doorway.",
      "final_answer": "They must turn right, cross the street, and then proceed straight towards the building entrance."

      "question": "What is the relative position of the people walking in the distance compared to the main entrance with the arched doorway?",
      "reasoning_chain": "1. The main entrance with the arched doorway is prominently located near the center-right of the image.  \n2. In the far background, towards the right side of the panorama, several people are visible walking on the street.  \n3. The people are further away from the camera and appear to be walking parallel to the building with the arched entrance.  \n4. Given the perspective and placement, the people are down the street and to the right of the main entrance from the viewer\u2019s perspective.",

      "reasoning_chain": "1. The left sidewalk runs along the greenery and stone wall, extending towards the left edge of the panorama.\n2. The crosswalk is visible in the central part of the image, near the intersection and the main street.\n3. From the farthest point on the left sidewalk, the person should walk straight along the sidewalk towards the central intersection.\n4. Upon reaching the intersection, they turn right and follow the shortest path to the crosswalk.",
      "final_answer": "Walk straight along the sidewalk towards the intersection, then turn right to reach the crosswalk."
