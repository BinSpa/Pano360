      "reasoning_chain": "1. Identify the central tree in the panoramic image, which is located roughly in the center of the image (around pixel 1024 horizontally).  \n2. Locate the building with mirrored glass panels. This building is visible towards the left section of the panorama (left of the central tree), with a reflection on its facade and modern architectural style.  \n3. Compare the spatial positions: The mirrored glass building is positioned to the left of the central tree, not to the right.",

      "reasoning_chain": "1. Visually divide the panorama in half at the central vertical axis (pixel 1024).  \n2. Count the number of visible trees on the left side (pixels 0-1023). There are about 5-6 trees clearly visible, both in the foreground and background.  \n3. Count the number of visible trees on the right side (pixels 1024-2047). There are about 7-8 trees, with several prominent ones lining the walkway.  \n4. Compare the counts: The right side of the image has a denser population of trees.",

      "question": "Does the curved bench follow the contour of the path or does it cut across the open area?",
      "reasoning_chain": "1. Observe the positioning of the curved bench in the foreground and mid-ground.  \n2. Note that the bench starts near the central tree and gently curves along the brick-paved walkway, following its curvature.  \n3. There is no indication that the bench cuts across the open dirt area; rather, it traces the edge of the path, defining it.",

Observe its placement in the panorama, which is just to the right of the central vertical axis (slightly right of center).  \n3. Compare this position to the right edge, where a taller white building is visible.",
