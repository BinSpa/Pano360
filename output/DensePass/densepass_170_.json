      "question": "Which side of the image shows more residential houses, and what evidence supports this conclusion?",
      "reasoning_chain": "1. The panoramic image is split into two main areas: the left side, which predominantly shows dense greenery and a sidewalk, and the right side, which shows a row of residential houses.\n2. On the right side (about 1024 pixels and beyond), several semi-detached houses with driveways and parked cars are visible, facing the street.\n3. The left side (from 0 to about 1024 pixels) primarily displays trees, bushes, and a smaller segment of a building partially obscured by foliage, with far fewer identifiable houses.\n4. The density and clarity of residential structures are much higher on the right side of the panorama.",
      "final_answer": "The right side of the image shows more residential houses."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the blue van parked closer to the greenery or to the row of houses, and how can you tell?",
      "reasoning_chain": "1. The blue van is located near the center-left of the image, positioned next to a sidewalk.\n2. To the left of the van, there is dense greenery occupying a significant part of the frame.\n3. The row of houses is mostly to the right of the van, further away spatially in the image.\n4. The van appears to be parked directly adjacent to the greenery, with only a fence or narrow strip of sidewalk separating them.",
      "final_answer": "The blue van is parked closer to the greenery."
    },
    {
      "question": "In which direction are most of the vehicles parked relative to the camera's viewpoint and the street's orientation?",
      "reasoning_chain": "1. The majority of visible vehicles (including black, white, and silver cars) are aligned parallel to the curb on the right side of the street.\n2. The vehicles are facing away from the camera's leftmost edge, indicating the driving direction is from left to right across the panorama.\n3. The blue van, parked near the center-left, also aligns with this orientation, suggesting standard parallel parking along the street.",
      "final_answer": "Most vehicles are parked parallel to the street, facing from left to right relative to the camera's viewpoint."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there more trees or cars visible in the image, and what steps lead to this answer?",
      "reasoning_chain": "1. There is a large cluster of trees and dense foliage visible on the left half of the image, encompassing multiple individual trees.\n2. The right half of the image displays about six cars parked on the street.\n3. Counting the trees and large bushes, there are clearly more than six, particularly in the left-central region.\n4. Thus, the number of visible trees and large bushes exceeds the number of cars.",
      "final_answer": "There are more trees than cars visible in the image."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the street depicted in the image straight or curved, and how can you infer this from the visual cues?",
      "reasoning_chain": "1. The panoramic format can distort straight lines, but the alignment of the houses and vehicles suggests the street\u2019s path.\n2. Both the row of houses and the series of parked vehicles on the right appear to follow a consistent, mostly linear trajectory from foreground to background.\n3. There is no significant visual evidence of a curve in the rows of houses, parked cars, or pavement edges that would indicate a bend in the street.",
      "final_answer": "The street depicted in the image is straight."
