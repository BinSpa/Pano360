  "prompt": "You are a language model tasked with generating spatial reasoning questions based on a panoramic scene with (h, w)=(2048, 4096).\n\nYour task is to generate complex spatial reasoning tasks using given object information, such as:\n- An object that satisfies multiple spatial constraints at once.\n- An object positioned between two others.\n- Comparison tasks involving sorting or ranking (by distance, height, etc.)\n- An object spatial position related to other objects.\nThe data format I need is a question, a chain of reasoning and the final answer. The format is shown below:\n    Question:\n    xxx\n    Reasoning Chain:\n    xxx\n    Final Answer:\n    xxx\nUse natural and diverse language.

      "question": "Which object is positioned directly between the standard doorway and the vertical architectural support structure, both in terms of proximity and alignment along the space, and how does its location compare in height and placement to the single chair?",
      "reasoning_chain": "To determine which object is situated between the standard doorway and the vertical architectural support structure, we need to consider their spatial arrangement within the room. The standard doorway is centrally located along the interior wall, while the vertical architectural support structure is further down the hallway. The large, rectangular fixture covered with various papers (the noticeboard) is positioned near the stairwell, making it a candidate for being between the two. The single chair, on the other hand, is near the doorway and placed inside the adjacent room. Comparing heights, the noticeboard is mounted higher on the wall than the chair, which sits near ground level. The noticeboard also occupies a middle ground spatially\u2014neither as close to the doorway as the chair nor as far as the support structure.",
      "final_answer": "The large, rectangular fixture covered with various papers (the noticeboard) is the object positioned between the standard doorway and the vertical architectural support structure. It is mounted higher on the wall compared to the single chair, which is located closer to the doorway and at a lower height."

    {
      "question": "If you were standing at the wide doorway facing into the stairwell, which object would you encounter first as you move straight ahead, the lone chair or the prominent wall-mounted information board, and how would the position of the sturdy, upright pillar relate to both as you continue further along the corridor?",
      "reasoning_chain": "Starting at the wide doorway, the lone chair is located just inside the adjacent room and close to the entrance, so it would be encountered immediately if stepping through the door but not moving deeper into the stairwell. However, moving straight ahead into the stairwell, the prominent wall-mounted information board is situated along the wall near the stairs, making it the first object encountered in that direction. The sturdy, upright pillar is positioned farther down the corridor than both the information board and the chair, acting as a structural marker further along the path.",
      "final_answer": "As you move straight ahead from the wide doorway into the stairwell, you would first encounter the prominent wall-mounted information board. The sturdy, upright pillar would be found even further along the corridor, beyond both the chair and the information board."

    {
      "question": "Imagine you are moving from the centrally positioned entranceway into the stairwell area. Which object do you reach first, the solitary chair or the large wall-mounted informational display? Additionally, which object is located farthest from the entranceway, and what does this suggest about the overall layout of the space?",
      "reasoning_chain": "As you step through the centrally positioned entranceway, the solitary chair is placed just beyond this point, likely close to the wall inside the connecting room, making it the first object encountered. The large wall-mounted informational display is positioned further along the wall in the stairwell area, so you would pass the chair before reaching it. The robust, vertical pillar is described as being situated deeper within the corridor, beyond the other objects mentioned. This suggests that the pillar is the farthest from the entranceway, indicating a sequence where the chair is closest, followed by the informational display, and finally the pillar is at the greatest distance.",
      "final_answer": "You would reach the solitary chair first upon entering, the large wall-mounted informational display next, and the robust, vertical pillar is located farthest from the entranceway. This sequence reveals a layout that guides movement from seating to information, and then further into the corridor\u2019s structural elements."

      "question": "Which object is situated higher up on the wall compared to the single, unaccompanied chair, and how does the position of this object help direct attention as people move from the interior doorway into the stairwell area? Additionally, describe the spatial relationship between this object and the tall, sturdy column in terms of their locations along the corridor.",
      "reasoning_chain": "The single, unaccompanied chair is described as being just inside the adjoining room, positioned low to the ground for seating. The prominent wall-mounted bulletin board, covered with notices and artwork, is fixed higher up on the wall along the stairwell path. As people move from the interior doorway into the stairwell area, the elevated placement of the bulletin board naturally draws attention to it, making it visible and accessible to those passing by. The tall, sturdy column is set deeper into the corridor, further beyond the location of the bulletin board. This places the bulletin board between the doorway and the column, both in terms of height and progression along the corridor.",
      "final_answer": "The prominent wall-mounted bulletin board is situated higher up on the wall compared to the single chair. Its elevated and central placement helps capture the attention of people moving from the interior doorway into the stairwell area. The bulletin board is also located closer to the doorway and stairwell than the tall, sturdy column, which stands deeper into the corridor."
