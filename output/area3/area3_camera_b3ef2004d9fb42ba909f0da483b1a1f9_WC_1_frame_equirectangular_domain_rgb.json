  "prompt": "You are a language model tasked with generating spatial reasoning questions based on a panoramic scene with (h, w)=(2048, 4096).\n\nYour task is to generate complex spatial reasoning tasks using given object information, such as:\n- An object that satisfies multiple spatial constraints at once.\n- An object positioned between two others.\n- Comparison tasks involving sorting or ranking (by distance, height, etc.)\n- An object spatial position related to other objects.\nThe data format I need is a question, a chain of reasoning and the final answer. The format is shown below:\n    Question:\n    xxx\n    Reasoning Chain:\n    xxx\n    Final Answer:\n    xxx\nUse natural and diverse language. Do not include coordinate values or measurements in your output.",

      "question": "Which object is both positioned closest to the sinks and is directly between the small pile of paper towels on the trash bin and the stray piece of trash on the ground?",
      "reasoning_chain": "First, identify the location of the sinks in the panoramic scene. The small pile of paper towels on the trash bin is near the sinks, and the stray piece of trash is between the sinks and the restroom stalls. The cleaning bucket or wastebasket is close to the entrance, which is farther from the sinks. The bundle of discarded paper towels is likely near the wall by the sinks. The object that is both closest to the sinks and positioned between the small pile on the trash bin and the stray piece of trash would be the bundle of discarded paper towels near the wall by the sinks.",

      "question": "Which object is positioned farther from the restroom entrance than the blue cleaning bucket near the entrance, but closer to the restroom stalls than the stack of used paper towels on the trash bin by the sinks?",
      "reasoning_chain": "The blue cleaning bucket is closest to the entrance, so any object farther from the entrance would be located deeper inside the restroom. The restroom stalls are toward the back, so the object closer to them than the stack of used paper towels (which is by the sinks) would be in the area between the sinks and the stalls. Among all the objects, the piece of discarded paper found on the ground between the sinks and the row of restroom stalls fits both criteria: it is farther from the entrance than the cleaning bucket and closer to the stalls than the stack of used paper towels.",
      "final_answer": "The piece of discarded paper or tissue found on the ground between the sinks and the row of restroom stalls."

      "question": "Which object can be found directly between the blue bucket or bin near the entry area and the loose piece of tissue or trash lying between the sinks and the toilet stalls?",
      "reasoning_chain": "The blue bucket or bin is located near the entrance, while the loose piece of tissue or trash is found further inside, between the sinks and the stalls. The cluster of used paper towels is on top of the trash bin beside the sinks, and the group of paper towels is scattered on the floor adjacent to the wall by the sinks. Considering their relative positions, the group of paper towels scattered on the floor by the wall is located between the entrance and the space leading to the stalls, thus making it the object directly between the blue bucket or bin and the loose piece of tissue or trash.",

      "question": "If you start at the blue cleaning bucket placed close to the restroom\u2019s entrance and move toward the area between the sinks and the restroom stalls, which object would you encounter last before reaching the single piece of thrown-away tissue on the floor?",
      "reasoning_chain": "The blue cleaning bucket is located near the entrance, so moving inward, you would first pass objects that are closer to the sinks, such as the heap of crumpled paper towels sitting on the trash bin next to the sinks and the collection of discarded paper towels spread out on the ground by the wall near the sinks. Between these, the object that is closest to the area between the sinks and stalls is the collection of discarded paper towels by the wall near the sinks, as it is positioned just before the space where the single piece of tissue is found.",
