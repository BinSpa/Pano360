  "prompt": "You are a language model tasked with generating spatial reasoning questions based on a panoramic scene with (h, w)=(2048, 4096).\n\nYour task is to generate complex spatial reasoning tasks using given object information, such as:\n- An object that satisfies multiple spatial constraints at once.\n- An object positioned between two others.\n- Comparison tasks involving sorting or ranking (by distance, height, etc.)\n- An object spatial position related to other objects.\nThe data format I need is a question, a chain of reasoning and the final answer. The format is shown below:\n    Question:\n    xxx\n    Reasoning Chain:\n    xxx\n    Final Answer:\n    xxx\nUse natural and diverse language. Do not include coordinate values or measurements in your output.",

      "question": "Which object is positioned directly between the single, modern chair with a mesh-like seat and backrest and the standing bookcase or shelving unit situated further to the right and slightly elevated?",
      "reasoning_chain": "The single, modern chair is placed close to one of the round tables in the seating area. The standing bookcase or shelving unit is further to the right and slightly elevated, close to the hallway. If we look for an object spatially located between these two, we see that the round table with a light-colored surface is placed centrally among the chairs, including the modern chair, and lies between the chair and the elevated bookcase.",
      "final_answer": "The round table with a light-colored surface is positioned directly between the chair and the standing bookcase or shelving unit."

    {
      "question": "Which object is closest to both the contemporary chair with a woven seat and back and the round, light-colored meeting table, while being farther from the tall bookcase set against the wall on the left side of the room?",
      "reasoning_chain": "The contemporary chair is placed near the round meeting table in the communal area, indicating a close spatial relationship between the two. The tall bookcase is farther to the left side of the room, making it less proximate to both the chair and the table. The raised shelving unit or bookcase on the right side is closer to the communal area than the tall bookcase on the left, but not as close as the table is to the chair.",
      "final_answer": "The round, light-colored meeting table is the object closest to both the contemporary chair and itself, while being farther from the tall bookcase set against the wall on the left side of the room."

    {
      "question": "Which object is positioned so that it is closest to the circular, pale-colored meeting table found in the center of the seating area, yet farther from the slim, tall shelving unit positioned along the left wall than the single, modern chair with a patterned fabric design?",
      "reasoning_chain": "The single, modern chair is located adjacent to the circular meeting table, making it the closest object to the table. The slim, tall shelving unit is positioned along the left wall, farther from the central area where the chair and table are situated. The boxy, elevated shelving unit on the right side of the room is near the hallway and further from the table than the chair is. Thus, between the chair and the shelving units, the chair is closest to the table but still farther from the slim, tall shelving unit than any objects on the left side.",
      "final_answer": "The single, modern chair with a patterned fabric design is the object closest to the circular, pale-colored meeting table and farther from the slim, tall shelving unit than the table itself."

    {
      "question": "Which object serves as a central point among the single, contemporary chair with a textured seat and back, the slender, upright shelving unit placed against the left wall, and the raised shelving unit or storage case situated on the right side of the room?",
      "reasoning_chain": "The round, light-toned table is described as centrally located in the room and surrounded by chairs, making it a communal workspace. The single, contemporary chair is next to this table. The slender shelving unit is against the left wall, and the raised shelving unit is on the right, both positioned away from the center. Because the table is centrally located and in close proximity to the chair, it naturally serves as a midpoint among the chair and both shelving units, which are on opposing sides of the room.",
      "final_answer": "The round, light-toned table centrally located in the room serves as the central point among the chair and both shelving units."
