  "prompt": "You are a language model tasked with generating spatial reasoning questions based on a panoramic scene with (h, w)=(2048, 4096).\n\nYour task is to generate complex spatial reasoning tasks using given object information, such as:\n- An object that satisfies multiple spatial constraints at once.\n- An object positioned between two others.\n- Comparison tasks involving sorting or ranking (by distance, height, etc.)\n- An object spatial position related to other objects.\nThe data format I need is a question, a chain of reasoning and the final answer. The format is shown below:\n    Question:\n    xxx\n    Reasoning Chain:\n    xxx\n    Final Answer:\n    xxx\nUse natural and diverse language.

      "question": "Which object is positioned directly between the long, blue cushioned sofa with several pillows and the set of items that could include electronics or media accessories placed on or around the desk close to the television on the wall?",
      "reasoning_chain": "The long, blue cushioned sofa is located along the wall beneath the framed pictures in the lounge area, while the set of tech-related clutter is near the desk by the television. To determine which object is directly between them, I need to consider the relative spatial arrangement of all described objects. The collection of small objects, possibly decorative pillows or personal belongings, arranged on or near the round ottoman, is likely situated between the sofa and the desk area, acting as a buffer zone or transition between the seating and the workspace.",
      "final_answer": "A collection of small objects, possibly decorative pillows or personal belongings, arranged on or near the round ottoman in front of the seating area."

      "question": "Which object is closer to the extended blue sofa with upholstered seats and back: the single cushioned chair with a curved back and armrests, or the several items that appear to be office supplies or personal gadgets, neatly arranged on the desk surface beside the television?",
      "reasoning_chain": "The extended blue sofa is positioned along the wall underneath framed artwork. The single cushioned chair is described as being near the corner of the lounge area, which is typically adjacent or close to the main seating space. The office supplies or personal gadgets are on a desk beside the television, which is placed further along the wall, likely at the far end of the lounge area. Given these descriptions and spatial cues, the single cushioned chair is positioned closer to the extended blue sofa than the desk with gadgets.",
      "final_answer": "The single cushioned chair with a curved back and armrests is closer to the extended blue sofa with upholstered seats and back."

      "question": "Which object in the lounge area is positioned to the left of the modern, upholstered lounge chair with a gently curved seat and also closest to the lengthy, blue fabric sofa with a low back and multiple cushions?",
      "reasoning_chain": "The modern, upholstered lounge chair is located near the main seating area. To its left, considering typical seating arrangements and the spatial layout, the cluster of round, textured decorative cushions is likely found on or near the lengthy, blue fabric sofa. Since these decorative cushions are described as being on or near the sofa, they are not only to the left of the lounge chair but are also the closest objects to the sofa itself.",
      "final_answer": "The cluster of round, textured decorative cushions arranged on or near the long sofa."

      "question": "Which object is both beside the elongated blue sofa with a minimalist design and also farther from the group of small electronic devices or accessories on the desk next to the television than the several patterned, circular decorative pillows?",
      "reasoning_chain": "The elongated blue sofa is positioned below a series of framed pictures. The several patterned, circular decorative pillows are situated on or near this sofa, so they are very close to it. The sleek, fabric-upholstered chair with a rounded back is described as being adjacent to the main lounge seating, which likely means it is positioned beside the sofa but not as close to the desk area as the decorative pillows might be. Given these spatial relationships, the chair fits the criteria of being beside the sofa and farther from the desk gadgets than the decorative pillows, which are closer to the sofa and may be nearer to the desk area due to their placement.",
      "final_answer": "The sleek, fabric-upholstered chair with a rounded back, placed adjacent to the main lounge seating."
