  "prompt": "You are a language model tasked with generating spatial reasoning questions based on a panoramic scene with (h, w)=(2048, 4096).\n\nYour task is to generate complex spatial reasoning tasks using given object information, such as:\n- An object that satisfies multiple spatial constraints at once.\n- An object positioned between two others.\n- Comparison tasks involving sorting or ranking (by distance, height, etc.)\n- An object spatial position related to other objects.\nThe data format I need is a question, a chain of reasoning and the final answer. The format is shown below:\n    Question:\n    xxx\n    Reasoning Chain:\n    xxx\n    Final Answer:\n    xxx\nUse natural and diverse language. Do not include coordinate values or measurements in your output.",

      "question": "Consider the large, rounded column positioned prominently in the middle of the hallway. Which object in the scene does this column directly obstruct from view if you are standing at the far left end of the hallway, looking toward the right?",
      "reasoning_chain": "If you stand at the far left end of the hallway and look toward the right, the large, rounded column stands centrally and acts as a visual barrier. Any object placed directly behind this column, from that vantage point, would be hidden from view. Since the column separates two different corridor spaces and is situated at a junction, anything positioned immediately on the other side of the column, such as objects near the trash can or fire extinguisher cabinet on the right side, would be obstructed from your line of sight.",
      "final_answer": "The large, rounded column would directly obstruct your view of objects such as the trash can and fire extinguisher cabinet if you are standing at the far left end of the hallway, looking toward the right."

    {
      "question": "If you start at the open cardboard box placed on the floor along the hallway and walk straight toward the large, rounded column positioned prominently in the middle of the hallway, which architectural feature will you pass just before reaching the column?",
      "reasoning_chain": "The open cardboard box is located along the hallway, while the large, rounded column stands centrally, separating two corridor spaces. As you move from the box toward the column, you would naturally follow the path of the hallway and encounter any features positioned along that route. Since the column is centrally located, and the hallway also contains doors and possibly other wall-mounted items, you would most likely pass by doorways before reaching the prominent column.",
      "final_answer": "You will pass a doorway just before reaching the large, rounded column."

    {
      "question": "Imagine you are standing next to the wooden door that stands partially open along the hallway. If you walk in the direction opposite the door\u2019s hinges, which object do you encounter first: the open cardboard box placed on the floor along the hallway, or the large, rounded column positioned prominently in the middle of the hallway?",
      "reasoning_chain": "The wooden door is located further down the hallway, while both the open cardboard box and the large, rounded column are positioned closer to the central part of the corridor. Walking in the direction opposite the door\u2019s hinges leads you back toward the main intersection of the hallway. Since the open cardboard box is situated on the floor along the hallway before reaching the central area where the column stands, you would encounter the box first before reaching the column.",
      "final_answer": "You would encounter the open cardboard box placed on the floor along the hallway first."

    {
      "question": "Suppose you are walking down the hallway from the large, rounded column positioned prominently in the middle of the hallway toward the tall, black trash bin situated further down and against the wall. Which major doorway do you pass before reaching the trash bin?",
      "reasoning_chain": "Starting at the large, rounded column in the middle of the hallway, you head down the corridor toward the end where the tall, black trash bin is located. Along this path, you would encounter the wooden door that stands partially open along the hallway, as it is situated between the column and the trash bin. This door serves as a noticeable entryway before reaching the end of the hallway where the trash bin stands.",
      "final_answer": "You pass the wooden door that stands partially open along the hallway before reaching the tall, black trash bin."
