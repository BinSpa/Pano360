  "prompt": "You are a language model tasked with generating spatial reasoning questions based on a panoramic scene with (h, w)=(2048, 4096).\n\nYour task is to generate complex spatial reasoning tasks using given object information, such as:\n- An object that satisfies multiple spatial constraints at once.\n- An object positioned between two others.\n- Comparison tasks involving sorting or ranking (by distance, height, etc.)\n- An object spatial position related to other objects.\nThe data format I need is a question, a chain of reasoning and the final answer. The format is shown below:\n    Question:\n    xxx\n    Reasoning Chain:\n    xxx\n    Final Answer:\n    xxx\nUse natural and diverse language.

      "question": "Which collection of random objects is positioned closest to the beginning of the left corridor, and how does its location relate to the small pile of miscellaneous items near the hallway intersection?",
      "reasoning_chain": "There are two sets of clutter along the left corridor: a collection of random objects gathered along the left side and a cluster of assorted objects near the doorway. Since the collection of random objects is described as being \"gathered along the left side of the corridor,\" and given its location information, it is situated nearer to the beginning of the corridor. The small pile of miscellaneous items is located near the hallway intersection, which is positioned further down and more toward the central part of the panoramic scene. Thus, the collection of random objects is closer to the corridor's start and is positioned further from the intersection compared to the small pile of miscellaneous items.",
      "final_answer": "The collection of random objects gathered along the left side of the corridor is closest to the beginning of the left corridor, and it is located further from the intersection than the small pile of miscellaneous items is."

      "question": "Which pile of clutter is situated between the cluster of cleaning supplies and empty bottles along the left corridor and the discarded office packaging beside the trash bin on the right? Describe its location in relation to these two objects.",
      "reasoning_chain": "There are three relevant descriptions: the cluster of cleaning supplies and empty bottles on the left corridor, the small pile of cardboard boxes and packing materials near a doorway, and the discarded office packaging beside the trash bin on the right. Based on the spatial arrangement: the cleaning supplies are along the left corridor near the beginning, the pile of cardboard boxes is further down the left hall, and the discarded office packaging is even further, on the right side near the trash bin. Therefore, the small pile of cardboard boxes and packing materials is positioned between the cluster of cleaning supplies and the discarded packaging by the trash bin.",
      "final_answer": "The small pile of cardboard boxes and packing materials stacked near a doorway on the left hall is situated between the cluster of cleaning supplies and empty bottles and the discarded office packaging beside the trash bin."

      "question": "If you start at the grouping of janitorial items and plastic bottles along the left wall of the corridor and move toward the bits of used packaging and snack wrappers next to the trash can on the right-hand side of the hallway, which heap of clutter would you encounter first, the disordered heap of dropped file folders and paperwork near where two hallways meet, or the flattened cardboard cartons and mail parcels stacked close to a doorway on the left side?",
      "reasoning_chain": "The grouping of janitorial items and plastic bottles is at the far left of the scene, indicating the start of the hallway. Moving from there toward the right side where the trash can and snack wrappers are located, you would pass by the flattened cardboard cartons and mail parcels stacked close to a doorway on the left before reaching the intersection. The disordered heap of dropped file folders and paperwork is situated near the intersection of two hallways, which is further along the route. Therefore, the first heap of clutter you encounter is the one with the flattened cardboard cartons and mail parcels.",
      "final_answer": "You would encounter the several flattened cardboard cartons and mail parcels stacked close to a doorway on the left side first."

      "question": "Which clutter object is both closer to the junction where the hallways cross than the assortment of cleaning bottles and janitorial supplies, and also positioned farther from the silver trash bin than the neat stack of shipping boxes and bubble wrap?",
      "reasoning_chain": "The scattered collection of folders, papers, and loose documents is specifically noted as being near the junction where the hallways cross, placing it closer to this intersection than the assortment of cleaning bottles and janitorial supplies, which are lined up against the left corridor wall farther away from the junction. The neat stack of shipping boxes and bubble wrap is by the doorway on the left, which is closer to the silver trash bin than the intersection itself. Therefore, the scattered collection of folders, papers, and loose documents is both closer to the hallway junction than the cleaning supplies and is farther from the trash bin than the shipping boxes.",
      "final_answer": "The scattered collection of folders, papers, and loose documents lying near the junction where the hallways cross."
