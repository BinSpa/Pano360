Based on these regions, \n    please generate a series of spatial reasoning data that includes detailed reasoning steps. \n    The questions should describe the spatial relationships between certain objects or infer the functional use of the region based on the objects present.\n    The data format I need is a question, a chain of reasoning and the final answer. The format is shown below:\n    Question:\n    xxx\n    Reasoning Chain:\n    xxx\n    Final Answer:\n    xxx\n\n    ---\n\n    Question:\n    xxx\n    Reasoning Chain:\n    xxx\n    Final Answer:\n    xxx\n",
