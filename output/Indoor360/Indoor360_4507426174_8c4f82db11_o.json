      "question": "What is the likely function of the area to the right with open shelving, given the visible spatial arrangement and adjacent features?",
      "reasoning_chain": "The area to the right contains built-in shelving, which is a common feature in storage or utility rooms. The shelves are open and accessible, suggesting frequent use for storing various items. This region is also separated from the main living space by a door, indicating it is meant for a specific, possibly utilitarian purpose rather than general living or display. Given the unfinished state of the room and the proximity to what looks like wiring and utility connections, it is likely meant for storage or as a pantry.",
      "final_answer": "The area to the right with open shelving is most likely intended to be a storage room or pantry."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the location of the large windows and glass doors in the center affect the functionality of the main room?",
      "reasoning_chain": "The large windows and glass doors are centrally located and provide access to an outdoor area, as well as substantial natural light to the main indoor space. This layout suggests that the main room is intended to be a living or communal area, where natural lighting and access to the outdoors are desirable. The openness and visibility to the outside enhance the room's usability for gatherings or relaxation.",
      "final_answer": "The large windows and glass doors make the main room ideal for communal living, providing natural light and outdoor access."
    },
    {
      "question": "Based on the unfinished materials against the left wall, what can be inferred about the current state of the room and its future use?",
      "reasoning_chain": "There are large boards and panels leaning against the left wall, along with visible construction materials and an unfinished wall surface. This indicates that the room is still under renovation or construction. The presence of such materials typically precedes the installation of cabinetry, built-ins, or partitions, which are common in kitchens, living rooms, or offices.",
      "final_answer": "The room is currently under renovation and is likely intended for a main living or multipurpose area once completed."
    },
    {
      "question": "What spatial relationship exists between the storage area with shelves and the potential kitchen/utility zone to the left?",
      "reasoning_chain": "The storage area with shelves is situated adjacent to the main room, with doors that could facilitate quick access. To the left, unfinished walls and utility connections suggest the location of a kitchen or utility space. The close proximity of storage to this potential kitchen area would be logical for storing pantry items, cleaning supplies, or household tools.",
      "final_answer": "The storage area with shelves is conveniently positioned near the likely kitchen/utility zone, suggesting a functional layout for easy access to supplies."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the open floor plan contribute to the adaptability of the space?",
      "reasoning_chain": "The image shows a mostly open central area, with only minimal partitioning for storage, which allows for flexible furniture arrangement and multifunctional use. Such a layout is conducive to adapting the space for different living arrangements, gatherings, or work-from-home setups, depending on the final furnishings and design choices.",
      "final_answer": "The open floor plan enhances adaptability, enabling the space to serve various purposes based on future needs."
