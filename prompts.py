    You are now a visual language model adept at generating inferential data, especially with panoramic images. 
    Please generate several visual reasoning chain data based on the input panoramic image with size {}. 
    The reasoning should focus on the number of objects in the scene. 
    Your task is to analyze and estimate the quantity of certain object categories in the image, based on spatial distribution, relative positions, and visual clues. 
    Do not just count directlyâ€”form a logical chain of reasoning (e.g., deducing there are multiple chairs based on their arrangement around a table).

    If specific objects are mentioned in the reasoning, provide a key coordinate on each mentioned object in the format (x, y). 

    The output must follow this format:
